Nature of the Notes and Investment Profile

The Notes will not constitute deposits under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act or under any other deposit insurance regime. The return on the Notes will be based on the performance of Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each) during the term of such Notes. The Notes are designed for investors seeking exposure to the specified Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each), and who are prepared to assume the risks associated with an investment linked to the specified Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each). An investment in the Notes involves risks. The Notes are not designed to be alternatives to fixed income or money market instruments. The Notes are only appropriate investments for persons who understand the risks associated with structured products and derivatives. The Notes are considered to be "specified derivatives" under applicable Canadian securities laws. An investment in the Notes does not represent a direct or indirect investment in the Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each) to which it is linked or its underlying interests, and investors do not have an ownership or any other interest (including voting rights or the right to receive any dividends, distributions or other income or amounts accruing or paid thereon) in respect of such Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each) or its or their underlying interests. A purchaser of Notes will be exposed to fluctuations and changes in the levels of the Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each) to which the Notes are linked. Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each) levels may be volatile and an investment linked to Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each) levels may also be volatile. The Notes do not guarantee the repayment of any amount of the principal (subject to the minimum principal repayment as may be specified in the applicable pricing supplement), or the payment of any return and may be subject to a cap or other limitation on return and may be fully exposed to any decline in the value of the securities or other interests that comprise the specified Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each). The amount received at maturity will depend on the performance of the Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each). A purchaser of Notes could lose substantially all of his or her investment in the Notes. See "Risk Factors" in the Prospectus, this product supplement and/or the applicable pricing supplement.

Risk Factors

An investment in the Notes is subject to the risks described below, as well as the risks described under "Risk Factors" in the Prospectus and the applicable pricing supplement. The Notes are not secured debt and involve greater risks than ordinary unsecured debt securities. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly or indirectly in the Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each). These risk factors shall be read with the necessary modifications to also apply to a Target Index and the underlying interests comprising a Target Index. The Notes are not appropriate investments for persons who do not understand the risks associated with structured products or derivatives. Prospective purchasers should carefully consider whether the Notes are suited to their respective particular circumstances. This section describes certain risks relating to an investment in the Notes. Prospective purchasers should read the following information about these risks, together with the other information in the Prospectus, this product supplement and/or the applicable pricing supplement, before investing in the Notes.

Principal at Risk Notes

The Notes do not guarantee the repayment of any amount of the principal, subject to the minimum principal repayment as may be specified in the applicable pricing supplement. The applicable pricing supplement for the Notes will specify the amount of the principal of the Notes that is "protected", which amount may be as little as 1% of the principal amount of such Notes. Notes in respect of which the minimum principal repayment by the Bank will be an amount in excess of 1% of the principal are referred to as "partially principal protected notes". All other Notes are "non-protected notes", which means that all but 1% of the principal amount of such Notes will be fully exposed and investors could lose substantially all of their investment subject to the minimum principal repayment of 1% of the principal amount of such Notes, or $1.00 per Note. See "Description of the Notes Principal at Risk" in the Prospectus.

An investment in the Notes may result in a loss
The Notes do not guarantee the return of the entire amount of the principal of the Notes and, unless otherwise specified in the applicable pricing supplement for the Notes, the Bank will not repay a fixed amount of principal on the Notes on their maturity date. The return on the Notes may be zero, positive or negative and will depend on the ... direction of and percentage change in the ... Canadian Financials Basket (CIBC, Great-West Lifeco, Manulife, Power Corp, TD; 20% each) over the applicable measurement period and the specified correlation between the direction of such change and the return on the Notes. ... a purchaser of the Notes may receive at maturity less, and possibly significantly less, than the principal amount of such Notes. Subject to any minimum principal repayment as specified in the applicable pricing supplement, purchasers of Notes could lose their entire investment.
