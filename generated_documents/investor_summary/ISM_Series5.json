If the Notes are called, holders will receive both the 100000000.00 and a Variable Return for the applicable Autocall Valuation Date. The Notes are callable on an annual basis and cannot be automatically called prior to August 14, 2026. If the Closing Portfolio Price on any Autocall Valuation Date is not greater than or equal to the applicable Autocall Price, the Notes will not be automatically called by the Bank and the Variable Return will not be paid to holders in respect of such Autocall Valuation Date.\n\nPotential Variable Return\nThe Variable Return, if any, applicable to each respective Valuation Date will be calculated using the following formula:\n\n100000000.00 x (Fixed Return + Additional Return)\n\nThe Additional Return, if any, is equal to 5.00% of the amount by which the Price Return on the applicable Valuation Date exceeds the applicable Fixed Return, calculated using the formula below:\n\n5.00% x (Price Return - Fixed Return)\n\nIf the Price Return on the applicable Valuation Date is equal to or less than the applicable Fixed Return, no Additional Return will be paid on the Notes.\n\nThe Fixed Return used in the calculation of the Variable Return, if any, and the calculation of the Additional Return, if any, for each Valuation Date will be as follows:\nAUTOCALL PAYMENT SCHEDULE\n┌────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────┐\n│ Valuation Date         │ Autocall Level                   │ Fixed Return     │\n├────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────┤\n│ August 14, 2026     │ 100.00% of the Initial Portfolio Price │ 8.50% │\n│ August 14, 2027     │ 100.00% of the Initial Portfolio Price │ 17.00% │\n│ August 14, 2028     │ 100.00% of the Initial Portfolio Price │ 25.50% │\n│ August 14, 2029     │ 100.00% of the Initial Portfolio Price │ 34.00% │\n│ August 14, 2030     │ 100.00% of the Initial Portfolio Price │ 42.50% │\n│ August 14, 2031     │ 100.00% of the Initial Portfolio Price │ 51.00% │\n│ January 28, 2032   │ 100.00% of the Initial Portfolio Price │ 59.50% │\n└────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┘\n\nContingent Principal Protection\n30.00% contingent principal protection.

  "scenarios": "\nEYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES\n\nThe following hypothetical examples show how the Variable Return and Maturity Redemption Amount would be calculated and determined based on certain\nhypothetical values and assumptions that are set out below. These examples are for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as an estimate or\nforecast of the performance of the Index or the return that an investor might realize on the Notes. The return on the Notes will be calculated based on the\nperformance of the Index, which reflects the gross total return performance of the Target Index as reduced by the Adjusted Return Factor. Certain dollar amounts\nare rounded to the nearest whole cent and “$” refers to the relevant currency for the specific hypothetical dollar amounts and hypothetical prices that the context\nrequires.\n\nExample #1 - The Notes are not automatically called as the Closing Index Level on each Autocall Valuation Date is less than the Autocall Level. The Final Index\nLevel on the January 28, 2032 is less than the Barrier Level and no Variable Return is payable.\n\nExample #2 - The Notes are not automatically called as the Closing Index Level on each Autocall Valuation Date is less than the Autocall Level. The Final Index\nLevel on the January 28, 2032 is less than the Autocall Level, but greater than or equal to the Barrier Level and no Variable Return is payable.\n\nExample #3 - The Notes are not automatically called as the Closing Index Level on each Autocall Valuation Date is less than the Autocall Level. The Final Index\nLevel on the January 28, 2032 is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level and a Variable Return is payable consisting of a Fixed Return only. No\nAdditional Return is payable as the Index Return is less than or equal to the Fixed Return.\n\nExample #4 - The Notes are not automatically called on the 2026 or 2027 Autocall Valuation Dates as the Closing Index Level is less than the Autocall Level.\nThe Notes are automatically called on the 2028 Autocall Valuation Date as the Closing Index Level is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level and a Variable\nReturn is payable consisting of a Fixed Return and an Additional Return as the Index Return is greater than the Fixed Return.\n\nExample #5 - The Notes are automatically called on the 2026 Autocall Valuation Date as the Closing Index Level is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level\nand a Variable Return is payable consisting of a Fixed Return only. No Additional Return is payable as the Index Return is less than the Fixed Return.\n",
