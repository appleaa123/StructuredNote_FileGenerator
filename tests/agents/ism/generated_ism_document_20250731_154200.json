Scotia Capital Inc. will use reasonable efforts under normal market conditions to provide a daily secondary market for the sale of the Notes but reserves the right to elect not to do so at any time in the future, in its sole and absolute discretion, without prior notice to holders.\n\nEarly Trading Charge\n[Include this section if applicable]\n\nEARLY TRADING CHARGE SCHEDULE\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502 If Sold Within            \u2502 Early Trading Charge (% of Principal Amount) \u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\n\u2502 0-90 days of August 13, 2025   \u2502 2.50%       \u2502\n\u2502 91-180 days of August 13, 2025 \u2502 1.25%     \u2502\n\u2502 Thereafter                \u2502 Nil                                    \u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\nEligibility for Investment\nEligible for RRSPs, RRIFs, RESPs, RDSPs, DPSPs, TFSAs and FHSAs.\n\nFees and Expenses\nThe selling concession to be paid by the Bank to Scotia Capital Inc. will be 2.50% of the Principal Amount per Note.

  "scenarios": "\nEYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES\n\nThe following hypothetical examples show how the Variable Return and Maturity Redemption Amount would be calculated and determined based on certain\nhypothetical values and assumptions that are set out below. These examples are for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as an estimate or\nforecast of the performance of the Index or the return that an investor might realize on the Notes. The return on the Notes will be calculated based on the\nperformance of the Index, which reflects the gross total return performance of the Target Index as reduced by the Adjusted Return Factor. Certain dollar amounts\nare rounded to the nearest whole cent and \u201c$\u201d refers to the relevant currency for the specific hypothetical dollar amounts and hypothetical prices that the context\nrequires.\n\nExample #1 - The Notes are not automatically called as the Closing Index Level on each Autocall Valuation Date is less than the Autocall Level. The Final Index\nLevel on the August 09, 2032 is less than the Barrier Level and no Variable Return is payable.\n\nExample #2 - The Notes are not automatically called as the Closing Index Level on each Autocall Valuation Date is less than the Autocall Level. The Final Index\nLevel on the August 09, 2032 is less than the Autocall Level, but greater than or equal to the Barrier Level and no Variable Return is payable.\n\nExample #3 - The Notes are not automatically called as the Closing Index Level on each Autocall Valuation Date is less than the Autocall Level. The Final Index\nLevel on the August 09, 2032 is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level and a Variable Return is payable consisting of a Fixed Return only. No\nAdditional Return is payable as the Index Return is less than or equal to the Fixed Return.\n\nExample #4 - The Notes are not automatically called on the 2026 or 2027 Autocall Valuation Dates as the Closing Index Level is less than the Autocall Level.\nThe Notes are automatically called on the 2028 Autocall Valuation Date as the Closing Index Level is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level and a Variable\nReturn is payable consisting of a Fixed Return and an Additional Return as the Index Return is greater than the Fixed Return.\n\nExample #5 - The Notes are automatically called on the 2026 Autocall Valuation Date as the Closing Index Level is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level\nand a Variable Return is payable consisting of a Fixed Return only. No Additional Return is payable as the Index Return is less than the Fixed Return.\n",

The Notes are not principal protected (subject to a minimum principal repayment of $1.00 per Note) and an investor may receive substantially less than the original principal amount at maturity. A person should reach a decision to invest in the Notes only after carefully considering, with his or her investment, legal, accounting, tax and other advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of his or her investment objectives and the information set out in the Prospectus. The Bank, the Calculation Agent, Scotia Capital Inc. and Scotia Capital Inc. make no recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment by any particular person. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"1933 Act\"), or any State securities laws and, subject to certain exceptions, may not be offered for sale, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly, in the United States, its territories or possessions or to or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons within the meaning of Regulation S under the 1933 Act. In addition, the Notes may not be offered or sold to residents of any jurisdiction or country in Europe. \"Scotiabank\" and \"Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets\" are registered trademarks of The Bank of Nova Scotia.

Unless otherwise specified in the Prospectus, the Bank does not guarantee that any of the principal amount of the Notes will be paid, or guarantee that any return will be paid on the Notes, at or prior to maturity (in each case, subject to a minimum principal repayment of $1.00 per Note). Purchasers could lose substantially all of their investment in the Notes. The Notes are not appropriate investments for persons who do not understand the risks associated with structured products or derivatives. A purchaser of the Notes will be exposed to fluctuations and changes in the levels of the Solactive Canada Insurance 220 AR Index to which the Notes are linked. The Solactive Canada Insurance 220 AR Index levels may be volatile and an investment linked to Solactive Canada Insurance 220 AR Index levels may also be volatile. Purchasers should read carefully the \"Risk Factors\" sections in the Prospectus.\n\nThe Notes will not constitute deposits under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act or under any other deposit insurance regime. The Notes have not been rated and will not be insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other entity and therefore the payments to investors will be dependent upon the financial health and creditworthiness of the Bank.\n\nScotia Capital Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank.

The Notes are not in any way sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by the Reference Companies.\n\nAll information in the pricing supplement relating to the Reference Companies including the Reference Shares is derived from publicly available sources and is presented in the pricing supplement in summary form.\n\nThe return payable on the Notes is linked to the price performance of the Reference Shares of the Reference Companies. Accordingly, certain risk factors applicable to investors who invest directly in the Reference Shares are also applicable to an investment in the Notes to the extent that such risk factors could adversely affect the performance of the Reference Shares. Prospective investors are urged to conduct their own independent investigation of the Reference Companies prior to making any investment decision with respect to the Notes. The Bank is not affiliated with the Reference Companies and has not performed any due diligence investigation or review of the Reference Companies.\n\nAn investment in the Notes does not represent a direct or indirect investment in the Reference Shares or the Reference Companies and investors do not have an ownership or any other interest (including voting rights or the right to receive any dividends, distributions or other income or amounts accruing or paid thereon) in respect of such Reference Shares.

Neither publication of the Index and Target Index by the Index Sponsor nor the licensing of the Index and Target Index or the trade marks of the Index and Target Index for the purpose of use in connection with the Notes constitutes a recommendation by the Index Sponsor to invest capital in the Notes nor does it in any way represent an assurance or opinion of the Index Sponsor with regard to any investment in the Notes.\n\nTRADEMARK NOTICE\nT\u2122 Trademark of The Bank of Nova Scotia, used under license (where applicable).
