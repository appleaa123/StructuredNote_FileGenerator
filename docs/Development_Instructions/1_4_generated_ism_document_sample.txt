KEY TERMS
----------------------------------------

Issuer
The Bank of Nova Scotia (the "Bank").

Index
The Solactive Canada Insurance 220 AR Index, a broad market index representing large-cap U.S. equities with strong historical performance and liquidity characteristics.

Autocall
The Notes will be automatically called (i.e., redeemed) by the Bank if the Closing Index Level on any Autocall Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level. If the Notes are called, holders will receive both the Principal Amount and a Variable Return for the applicable Autocall Valuation Date. The Notes are callable on an annual basis and cannot be automatically called prior to August 13, 2026. If the Closing Index Level on any Autocall Valuation Date is not greater than or equal to the applicable Autocall Level, the Notes will not be automatically called by the Bank and the Variable Return will not be paid to holders in respect of such Autocall Valuation Date.

Potential Variable Return
The Variable Return, if any, applicable to each respective Valuation Date will be calculated using the following formula:

Principal Amount x (Fixed Return + Additional Return)

The Additional Return, if any, is equal to 5.00% of the amount by which the Index Return on the applicable Valuation Date exceeds the applicable Fixed Return, calculated using the formula below:

5.00% x (Index Return - Fixed Return)

If the Index Return on the applicable Valuation Date is equal to or less than the applicable Fixed Return, no Additional Return will be paid on the Notes.

The Fixed Return used in the calculation of the Variable Return, if any, and the calculation of the Additional Return, if any, for each Valuation Date will be as follows:

Contingent Principal Protection
30.00% contingent principal protection. The Notes provide contingent principal protection at maturity if the Final Index Level on the August 09, 2032 is greater than or equal to the Barrier Level (which is 70.00% of the Initial Index Level). If the Final Index Level on the August 09, 2032 is less than the Barrier Level, a holder of the Notes will be fully exposed to any negative performance of the Solactive Canada Insurance 220 AR Index, meaning that substantially all of such holder's investment may be lost (subject to a minimum principal repayment of $1.00 per Note).

└──────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┘

Each of the Valuation Dates (other than the August 09, 2032) is an "Autocall Valuation Date". Unless the Notes are automatically called by the Bank prior to maturity, the August 09, 2032 is the last Payment Date. If the Notes are automatically called (i.e., redeemed) by the Bank on any Call Date prior to the August 09, 2032, the Notes will be cancelled, all amounts due shall be paid to holders on the applicable Payment Date and holders will not be entitled to receive any subsequent payments in respect of the Notes.

If an Autocall Valuation Date is not an Exchange Business Day then the Autocall Valuation Date will be the immediately preceding Exchange Business Day, subject to the occurrence of any special circumstances (see "Special Circumstances" in the pricing supplement). If a Payment Date, a Call Date or the August 09, 2032 is not a Business Day then the related payment the Bank is obligated to make on such day, if any, will be paid to the holder on the immediately following Business Day, subject to the occurrence of any special circumstances (see "Special Circumstances" in the pricing supplement), and no interest shall be paid in respect of such delay.

Maturity Redemption Amount
Holders of record will be entitled to an amount payable per Note if the Notes are automatically called by the Bank, or at maturity, as the case may be (in each case, the "Maturity Redemption Amount") as calculated by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the applicable formula below:

If the Closing Index Level on an Autocall Valuation Date or the Final Index Level on the August 09, 2032 is greater than or equal to the applicable Autocall Level, the Maturity Redemption Amount will equal:
Principal Amount + Variable Return

If the Final Index Level on the August 09, 2032 is less than the Autocall Level but greater than or equal to the Barrier Level, the Maturity Redemption Amount will equal:
Principal Amount

If the Final Index Level on the August 09, 2032 is less than the Barrier Level, the Maturity Redemption Amount will equal:
Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Index Return)

The Maturity Redemption Amount will be substantially less than the Principal Amount invested by an investor if the Final Index Level on the August 09, 2032 is less than the Barrier Level. The Maturity Redemption Amount will be subject to a minimum principal repayment of $1.00 per Note.

Autocall Level
100.00% of the Initial Index Level

Barrier Level
70.00% of the Initial Index Level.

Index Return
The Index Return is an amount expressed as a percentage (which can be zero, positive or negative) calculated by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following formula:
(Final Index Level - Initial Index Level) / Initial Index Level

Listing and Secondary Market
The Notes will not be listed on any exchange or marketplace. Scotia Capital Inc. will use reasonable efforts under normal market conditions to provide a daily secondary market for the sale of the Notes but reserves the right to elect not to do so at any time in the future, in its sole and absolute discretion, without prior notice to holders.

SCENARIOS
----------------------------------------

EYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES

The following hypothetical examples show how the Variable Return and Maturity Redemption Amount would be calculated and determined based on certain
hypothetical values and assumptions that are set out below. These examples are for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as an estimate or
forecast of the performance of the Index or the return that an investor might realize on the Notes. The return on the Notes will be calculated based on the
performance of the Index, which reflects the gross total return performance of the Target Index as reduced by the Adjusted Return Factor. Certain dollar amounts
are rounded to the nearest whole cent and “$” refers to the relevant currency for the specific hypothetical dollar amounts and hypothetical prices that the context
requires.

Example #1 - The Notes are not automatically called as the Closing Index Level on each Autocall Valuation Date is less than the Autocall Level. The Final Index
Level on the August 09, 2032 is less than the Barrier Level and no Variable Return is payable.

Example #2 - The Notes are not automatically called as the Closing Index Level on each Autocall Valuation Date is less than the Autocall Level. The Final Index
Level on the August 09, 2032 is less than the Autocall Level, but greater than or equal to the Barrier Level and no Variable Return is payable.

Example #3 - The Notes are not automatically called as the Closing Index Level on each Autocall Valuation Date is less than the Autocall Level. The Final Index
Level on the August 09, 2032 is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level and a Variable Return is payable consisting of a Fixed Return only. No
Additional Return is payable as the Index Return is less than or equal to the Fixed Return.

Example #4 - The Notes are not automatically called on the 2026 or 2027 Autocall Valuation Dates as the Closing Index Level is less than the Autocall Level.
The Notes are automatically called on the 2028 Autocall Valuation Date as the Closing Index Level is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level and a Variable
Return is payable consisting of a Fixed Return and an Additional Return as the Index Return is greater than the Fixed Return.

Example #5 - The Notes are automatically called on the 2026 Autocall Valuation Date as the Closing Index Level is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level
and a Variable Return is payable consisting of a Fixed Return only. No Additional Return is payable as the Index Return is less than the Fixed Return.


DISCLAIMER
----------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER
No securities regulatory authority has in any way passed upon the merits of the securities referred to herein and any representation to the contrary is an offence. The Notes are not principal protected (subject to a minimum principal repayment of $1.00 per Note) and an investor may receive substantially less than the original principal amount at maturity. A person should reach a decision to invest in the Notes only after carefully considering, with his or her investment, legal, accounting, tax and other advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of his or her investment objectives and the information set out in the Prospectus. The Bank, the Calculation Agent, Scotia Capital Inc. and Scotia Capital Inc. make no recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment by any particular person. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), or any State securities laws and, subject to certain exceptions, may not be offered for sale, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly, in the United States, its territories or possessions or to or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons within the meaning of Regulation S under the 1933 Act. In addition, the Notes may not be offered or sold to residents of any jurisdiction or country in Europe. "Scotiabank" and "Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets" are registered trademarks of The Bank of Nova Scotia. Scotia Capital Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Bank of Nova Scotia.

Amounts paid to holders of the Notes will depend on the performance of the underlying interests. Unless otherwise specified in the Prospectus, the Bank does not guarantee that any of the principal amount of the Notes will be paid, or guarantee that any return will be paid on the Notes, at or prior to maturity (in each case, subject to a minimum principal repayment of $1.00 per Note). Purchasers could lose substantially all of their investment in the Notes. The Notes are not appropriate investments for persons who do not understand the risks associated with structured products or derivatives. A purchaser of the Notes will be exposed to fluctuations and changes in the levels of the Solactive Canada Insurance 220 AR Index to which the Notes are linked. The Solactive Canada Insurance 220 AR Index levels may be volatile and an investment linked to Solactive Canada Insurance 220 AR Index levels may also be volatile. Purchasers should read carefully the "Risk Factors" sections in the Prospectus.

The Notes will not constitute deposits under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act or under any other deposit insurance regime. The Notes have not been rated and will not be insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other entity and therefore the payments to investors will be dependent upon the financial health and creditworthiness of the Bank.

Scotia Capital Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. Consequently, the Bank is a related and connected issuer of Scotia Capital Inc. within the meaning of applicable securities legislation. See "Plan of Distribution" in the Prospectus.

All information in the pricing supplement relating to the Reference Companies including the Reference Shares is derived from publicly available sources and is presented in the pricing supplement in summary form.

The return payable on the Notes is linked to the price performance of the Reference Shares of the Reference Companies.

Prospective investors are urged to conduct their own independent investigation of the Reference Companies prior to making any investment decision with respect to the Notes. The Bank is not affiliated with the Reference Companies and has not performed any due diligence investigation or review of the Reference Companies.

An investment in the Notes does not represent a direct or indirect investment in the Reference Shares or the Reference Companies and investors do not have an ownership or any other interest (including voting rights or the right to receive any dividends, distributions or other income or amounts accruing or paid thereon) in respect of such Reference Shares.

[Use the following section for notes linked to an index]

INDEX SPONSOR
The Index Sponsor and the Bank have entered into a non-exclusive license agreement providing for the license to the Bank, in exchange for a fee, of the right to use the Index and the Target Index, which are owned, calculated, administered and published by the Index Sponsor, in connection with the Notes.

The license agreement between the Index Sponsor and the Bank provides that the following language must be set forth herein:

The Index and Target Index are calculated and published by the Index Sponsor. The Index Sponsor uses its best efforts to ensure that the Index and Target Index are calculated correctly. Irrespective of its obligations towards the Bank, the Index Sponsor has no obligation to point out errors in the Index and Target Index to third parties including but not limited to investors and/or financial intermediaries of the Notes. Neither publication of the Index and Target Index by the Index Sponsor nor the licensing of the Index and Target Index or the trade marks of the Index and Target Index for the purpose of use in connection with the Notes constitutes a recommendation by the Index Sponsor to invest capital in the Notes nor does it in any way represent an assurance or opinion of the Index Sponsor with regard to any investment in the Notes.
