# Product Supplement Knowledge Base

This knowledge base is currently empty and needs to be populated with your own financial documents.

## 🔒 **Security Notice**

The original knowledge base contained sensitive financial data and has been removed for open source distribution.

## 📋 **What You Need to Do**

1. **Prepare Your Documents**: Convert your financial documents to text format
2. **Remove Sensitive Information**: Ensure no proprietary data is included
3. **Use Generic Examples**: Replace company-specific details with placeholders
4. **Build Knowledge Base**: Use LightRAG to create your knowledge base

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

```python
from lightrag import LightRAG

# Initialize LightRAG
rag = LightRAG()

# Add your documents (ensure they contain no sensitive data)
documents = [
    "Your generic financial document 1",
    "Your generic financial document 2",
    # ... add more documents
]

# Add documents to the knowledge base
rag.add_documents(documents)

# Save the knowledge base
rag.save("knowledge_bases/product_supplement_kb")
```

## 📁 **Required Files**

After building, this directory should contain:
- `kv_store_full_docs.json` - Full document content
- `kv_store_text_chunks.json` - Document chunks for retrieval
- `vdb_chunks.json` - Vector database chunks
- `vdb_entities.json` - Entity information
- `vdb_relationships.json` - Relationship data
- `graph_chunk_entity_relation.graphml` - Knowledge graph

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Never commit sensitive financial data** to version control
- **Test thoroughly** with your knowledge base before production use
- **Ensure compliance** with relevant financial regulations
- **Use generic examples** that can be customized by others
