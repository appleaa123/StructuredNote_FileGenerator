Nature of the Notes and Investment Profile

The Notes will not constitute deposits under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act or under any other deposit insurance regime. The return on the Notes will be based on the performance of [Underlying Asset Name] during the term of such Notes. The Notes are designed for investors seeking exposure to the specified [Underlying Asset Name], and who are prepared to assume the risks associated with an investment linked to the specified [Underlying Asset Name]. An investment in the Notes involves risks. The Notes are not designed to be alternatives to fixed income or money market instruments. The Notes are only appropriate investments for persons who understand the risks associated with structured products and derivatives. The Notes are considered to be "specified derivatives" under applicable Canadian securities laws. An investment in the Notes does not represent a direct or indirect investment in the [Underlying Asset Name] to which it is linked or its underlying interests, and investors do not have an ownership or any other interest (including voting rights or the right to receive any dividends, distributions or other income or amounts accruing or paid thereon) in respect of such [Underlying Asset Name] or its or their underlying interests. A purchaser of Notes will be exposed to fluctuations and changes in the levels of the [Underlying Asset Name] to which the Notes are linked. [Underlying Asset Name] levels may be volatile and an investment linked to [Underlying Asset Name] levels may also be volatile. The Notes do not guarantee the repayment of any amount of the principal (subject to the minimum principal repayment as may be specified in the applicable pricing supplement), or the payment of any return and may be subject to a cap or other limitation on return and may be fully exposed to any decline in the value of the securities or other interests that comprise the specified [Underlying Asset Name]. The amount received at maturity will depend on the performance of the [Underlying Asset Name]. A purchaser of Notes could lose substantially all of his or her investment in the Notes.

Prospectus Structure and Document Incorporation

Prospectus for Notes
Notes that may be issued under the Bank's senior (principal at risk) note program are direct senior unsecured and unsubordinated debt securities. The [Note Type] will be described in separate documents, including: (1) the Prospectus, and (2) (i) this product supplement, which generally describes a particular type of Note the Bank may issue under its senior (principal at risk) note program, as described in the Prospectus, and/or (ii) a pricing supplement that contains the specific terms (including pricing information) about the Notes being offered. In respect of any particular [Note Type] the Bank may offer under its senior (principal at risk) note program, the Prospectus together with this product supplement and/or the applicable pricing supplement will collectively constitute the "prospectus" in respect of such Notes. Each of these documents should be read and considered carefully before a prospective purchaser makes an investment decision in respect of the Notes. See "About this Prospectus for Notes" in the Prospectus. A copy of the Prospectus for the Notes will be available at [Website for Note Information].

Documents Incorporated by Reference
This product supplement is deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus solely for the purpose of the Notes issued pursuant hereto.

All other Notes are "non-protected notes", which means that all but 1% of the principal amount of such Notes will be fully exposed and investors could lose substantially all of their investment subject to the minimum principal repayment of 1% of the principal amount of such Notes, or $1.00 per Note.

An investment in the Notes is subject to the risks described below, as well as the risks described under "Risk Factors" in the Prospectus and the applicable pricing supplement.

The Notes are not appropriate investments for persons who do not understand the risks associated with structured products or derivatives. Prospective purchasers should carefully consider whether the Notes are suited to their respective particular circumstances.
