Offering_Overview = """
Offering Overview

The Bank of Nova Scotia (the "Bank") is offering up to [Currency Symbol][Maximum Offering Size in Dollars] [Note Name], Series [Series Number] ([Currency Code]) (the "Notes").

The Notes are principal at risk notes that offer a return linked to the [Underlying Asset Name]. Whether there is a return on the Notes through the Variable Return and whether the Principal Amount is returned at maturity is based on the performance of the [Index/Reference Portfolio]. The return on the Notes will not reflect the total return that an investor would receive if such investor owned the securities included in the [Target Asset(s) Name].

The Notes will be automatically called (i.e., redeemed) by the Bank if the [Closing Index Level/Closing Portfolio Price] on any Autocall Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the [Autocall Level/Price details]. If the Notes are called, holders will receive both the Principal Amount and a Variable Return for the applicable Autocall Valuation Date. The Notes are callable on an annual basis and cannot be automatically called prior to [First Possible Call Date].

If the Notes are not automatically called by the Bank, and the [Final Index Level/Final Portfolio Price] on the Final Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Autocall Level, holders will receive both the Principal Amount and a Variable Return. If the Notes are not automatically called by the Bank, the Notes provide contingent principal protection at maturity if the [Final Index Level/Final Portfolio Price] on the Final Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the [Barrier Level/Barrier Price] (which is [Barrier/Buffer Level Percentage]% of the [Initial Level/Price]).

General Risks and Guarantees

The Notes will not constitute deposits insured under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act or under any other deposit insurance regime.

An investment in the Notes involves risks. The Notes are not designed to be alternatives to fixed income or money market instruments. The Notes are only appropriate investments for persons who understand the risks associated with structured products and derivatives. The Notes are considered to be "specified derivatives" under applicable Canadian securities laws.

None of the Bank, the Investment Dealers or any of their respective affiliates, or any other person guarantees that investors in the Notes will receive an amount equal to their original investment (subject to a minimum principal repayment of [Currency Symbol]1.00 per Note), or guarantees that any return will be paid on the Notes, at or prior to maturity. The Maturity Redemption Amount will depend on the performance of the [Index/Reference Portfolio].

Deferred Payment
The following disclosure supersedes in its entirety the disclosure under "Deferred Payment" set forth at page 16 in the base shelf prospectus, and is deemed to be incorporated by reference into the base shelf prospectus.

This prohibition may not apply, depending on the amount of the credit advanced and, in certain circumstances, the annual percentage rate of interest received by the lender/investor on such credit advanced. The Bank will not, to the extent permitted by law, voluntarily claim the benefits of any laws concerning usurious rates of interest.

Forward-looking Statements
From time to time, the Bank's public communications include oral or written forward-looking statements. Statements of this type are included in this document, and may be included in other filings with Canadian securities regulators or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), or in other communications. In addition, representatives of the Bank may include forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. All such statements are made pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and any applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management's Discussion and Analysis in the Bank's 2024 Annual Report under the headings "Outlook" and in other statements regarding the Bank's objectives, strategies to achieve those objectives, the regulatory environment in which the Bank operates, anticipated financial results, and the outlook for the Bank's businesses and for the Canadian, U.S. and global economies. Such statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as "believe," "expect," "aim," "achieve," "foresee," "forecast," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "outlook," "seek," "schedule," "plan," "goal," "strive," "target," "project," "commit," "objective," and similar expressions of future or conditional verbs, such as "will," "may," "should," "would," "might," "can" and "could" and positive and negative variations thereof. By their very nature, forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, which give rise to the possibility that the Bank's predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations or conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that the Bank's assumptions may not be correct and that the Bank's financial performance objectives, vision and strategic goals will not be achieved. The Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements as a number of risk factors, many of which are beyond the Bank's control and effects of which can be difficult to predict, could cause the Bank's actual results to differ materially from the expectations, targets, estimates or intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements.

...[This section continues with a detailed list of risk factors, which is identical across all documents]...

Any forward-looking statements contained in the 2024 Annual Report represent the views of management only as of the date thereof and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank's financial position, objectives and priorities, and anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Except as required by law, the Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on its behalf.
